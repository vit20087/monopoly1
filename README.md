# Monopoly Game Java Implementation

A Java-based Monopoly board game simulation with a graphical user interface built using Swing. This application provides a simplified version of the classic Monopoly game that supports multiple players with an interactive board display.

## Features

- Complete game board with 40 spaces representing traditional Monopoly properties
- Support for 4 players with color-coded tokens and property ownership indicators
- Dice rolling mechanics with animated player movement across the board
- Property purchasing system with ownership tracking
- Rent calculation and payment between players
- Special spaces including:
    - GO (collect $200)
    - Chance and Community Chest cards with random effects
    - Tax squares
    - Jail and Go To Jail
- Game log that tracks all game events and transactions
- Visual representation of player positions, owned properties, and turn status

## Technical Implementation

- Object-oriented design with classes for Game, Player, and Property
- Java Swing UI with custom rendering for the game board, player tokens, and property cards
- Event-driven architecture for handling player actions and game state changes
- Color-coded visual elements for intuitive gameplay
- Responsive layout that updates in real-time to reflect the current game state

This implementation focuses on the core mechanics of Monopoly while providing a clean visual interface. Future enhancements could include property improvements (houses/hotels), mortgage options, trading between players, and more sophisticated AI for computer players.
